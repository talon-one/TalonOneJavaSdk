/*
 * Talon.One API
 * The Talon.One API is used to manage applications and campaigns, as well as to integrate with your application. The operations in the _Integration API_ section are used to integrate with our platform, while the other operations are used to manage applications and campaigns.  ### Where is the API?  The API is available at the same hostname as these docs. For example, if you are reading this page at `https://mycompany.talon.one/docs/api/`, the URL for the [updateCustomerProfile][] operation is `https://mycompany.talon.one/v1/customer_profiles/id`  [updateCustomerProfile]: #operation--v1-customer_profiles--integrationId--put

The &#x60;sessionId&#x60; body parameter is required, an event is always part of a session. Much like updating a customer session, if either the profile or the session do not exist, a new empty one will be created. Note that if the specified session already exists, it must belong to the same &#x60;profileId&#x60; or an error will be returned.  As with customer sessions, you can use an empty string for &#x60;profileId&#x60; to indicate that this is an anonymous session.  Updating a customer profile will return a response with the full integration state. This includes the current state of the customer profile, the customer session, the event that was recorded, and an array of effects that took place.

The &#x60;integrationId&#x60; may be any identifier that will remain stable for the customer. For example, you might use a database ID, an email, or a phone number as the &#x60;integrationId&#x60;. It is vital that this ID **not** change over time, so **don&#39;t** use any identifier that the customer can update themselves. E.g. if your application allows a customer to update their e-mail address, you should instead use a database ID.  Updating a customer profile will return a response with the full integration state.

     * Update a Customer Session
     *
     * Update (or create) a [Customer Session][]. For example, the items in a customers cart are part of a session.  The Talon.One platform supports multiple simultaneous sessions for the same profile, so if you have multiple ways of accessing the same application you have the option of either tracking multiple independent sessions or using the same session across all of them. You should share sessions when application access points share other state, such as the users cart. If two points of access to the application have independent state (e.g. a user can have different items in their cart across the two) they should use independent customer session ID&#39;s.  The &#x60;profileId&#x60; parameter in the request body should correspond to an &#x60;integrationId&#x60; for a customer profile, to track an anonymous session use the empty string (&#x60;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60;) as the &#x60;profileId&#x60;. Note that you do **not** need to create a customer profile first: if the specified profile does not yet exist, an empty profile will be created automatically.  Updating a customer profile will return a response with the full integration state. This includes the current state of the customer profile, the customer session, the event that was recorded, and an array of effects that took place.  The currency for the session and the cart items in the session is the same as that of the application with which the session is associated.  [Customer Session]: /entities/#customer-session
