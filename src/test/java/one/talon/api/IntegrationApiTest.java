As with customer sessions, you can use an empty string for &#x60;profileId&#x60; to indicate that this is an anonymous session.

It is vital that this ID **not** change over time, so **don&#39;t** use any identifier that the customer can update themselves.

     * Update (or create) a [Customer Session][]. For example, the items in a customers cart are part of a session.  The Talon.One platform supports multiple simultaneous sessions for the same profile, so if you have multiple ways of accessing the same application you have the option of either tracking multiple independent sessions or using the same session across all of them. You should share sessions when application access points share other state, such as the users cart. If two points of access to the application have independent state (e.g. a user can have different items in their cart across the two) they should use independent customer session ID&#39;s.  The &#x60;profileId&#x60; parameter in the request body should correspond to an &#x60;integrationId&#x60; for a customer profile, to track an anonymous session use the empty string (&#x60;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60;) as the &#x60;profileId&#x60;. Note that you do **not** need to create a customer profile first: if the specified profile does not yet exist, an empty profile will be created automatically.  Updating a customer profile will return a response with the full integration state. This includes the current state of the customer profile, the customer session, the event that was recorded, and an array of effects that took place.  The currency for the session and the cart items in the session is the same as that of the application with which the session is associated.
